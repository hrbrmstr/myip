`myip`: Tools to Determine Your Public 'IP' Address(es)

It is often necessary to know the 'IPv4' and/or 'IPv6' external addresses of a workstation for 'API' calls. Functions are provided to use one or more external services to accomplish this task along with a wrapper function that can return results from multiple services or use a random service.

The following functions are implemented:

- `akamai`:	Use whatismyip.akamai.com to retrieve public IP address
- `amazon`:	Use checkip.amazonaws.com to retrieve public IP address
- `httpbin`:	Use httpbin.org to retrieve public IP address
- `icanhazip`:	Use icanhazip to retrieve public IP address
- `ifcfgme`:	Use ifcfg.me to retrieve public IP address
- `ipecho`:	Use ipecho.net/plain to retrieve public IP address
- `ipinfo`:	Use ipinfo.io/ip to retrieve public IP address
- `myip`:	Wrapper function for getting your IP address
- `opendns`:	Use checkip.dyndns.org to retrieve public IP address
- `shuffit`:	Use shtuff.it/myip/short retrieve public IP address
